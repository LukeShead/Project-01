HND Game development Project 01

## IDE, Implementation and standards of project 1.

## The IDE I used to design this product is the original Notepad,

I used this to write the code as it is the most basic text editor, this was to show me what the difference was between a basic text editor and a code development software. Learning that there are many things that other IDE's can offer many more features such as debugging, however using notepad showed me how difficult it can be to write code with no help from the software, this has helped me understand the importance of IDE's.

## The implementation.

In order to implement the code, I used a method of finding code online, learning it and what each line does, then writing my own to help me understand how it is written. This usually worked however by not taking individual problems and solving them one by one I tried to solve the whole thing at once and because of this it means that the program was filled with errors and not allowing me to finish by the deadline.

## Coding standards.

I used tabs to make my work look better for me, by being able to place them all in a structure I was able to read the code better, this is my standard of coding and it helps me understand what functions go with what variables, for example I will put certain lines of text further to the right since people read left to right, having something to distinguish the code helps.

## Debugging.

With debugging I had to attempt to debug the code myself, this is because notepad does not have any forms of debugging available which means errors needed to be found and fixed myself.
